usage: |-
  [Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-at-the-edge.html) is an extension of AWS Lambda, a compute service that lets you execute functions that customize the content that CloudFront delivers.
  ### Requirements
  You must use a versioned S3 bucket for your deployment artifacts


# Example usage
examples: |-
  You just point it at a set of local file globs and it handles bundling your code and deploying it.
  ```hcl
      module "security_header_lambda" {
        source                          = "it::ssh://git@github.com/aws-terraform-module-lambda-at-edge.git"
        function_name                   = "security_headers"
        environment                     = "p"
        description                     = "Adds security headers to the response"
        lambda_runtime                  = "nodejs12.x"
        s3_artifact_bucket_name         = "lambda-edge-us-east-1-bucket-app"
        lambda_code_source_dir          = "./scripts/security_headers" # script from AWS blog below
        common_tags                     = var.common_tags
      }
