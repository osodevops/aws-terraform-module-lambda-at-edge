This module supports any type of Lambda Function supported by Edge, including NodeJs and Python functions.

---






## Usage

[Lambda@Edge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-at-the-edge.html) is an extension of AWS Lambda, a compute service that lets you execute functions that customize the content that CloudFront delivers.
### Requirements
You must use a versioned S3 bucket for your deployment artifacts




## Examples

You just point it at a set of local file globs and it handles bundling your code and deploying it.
```hcl
    module "security_header_lambda" {
      source                          = "it::ssh://git@github.com/aws-terraform-module-lambda-at-edge.git"
      function_name                   = "security_headers"
      environment                     = "p"
      description                     = "Adds security headers to the response"
      lambda_runtime                  = "nodejs12.x"
      s3_artifact_bucket_name         = "lambda-edge-us-east-1-bucket-app"
      lambda_code_source_dir          = "./scripts/security_headers" # script from AWS blog below
      common_tags                     = var.common_tags
    }
```
